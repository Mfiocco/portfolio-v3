                                <p>The challenge for this project was to capture the complexities and nuances of the
                                    city
                                    while simplifying its essence to create a logo that resonates with the local people
                                    as
                                    well as extendeds a warm welcome to visitors.

                                <p>Through the creative process I was able to extract key characteristics that speak to

                                <p>Throughout my research I identified important themes that I wanted to explore. I
                                    looked into the history behind the city and how it emerged as a touristic hotspot. I
                                    explored the culture, examining arts, textiles, ceramics, folklore and geographical
                                    importance. The story of a quaint fishing village that gained prominence as a
                                    shipping
                                    port
                                    particularly captured my attention, as did the folklore surrounding the town's name.
                                    These
                                    themes, along with others, allowed me to immerse myself in the important heritage of
                                    the
                                    town.

                                <p>Focusing my research on key themes was crucial to guiding my sketching process. From
                                    there, I
                                    experimented with different logo styles and explored various directions that could
                                    express
                                    these themes until I settled on three concepts that were strong enough to move
                                    forward
                                    with.

                            Illustrator, where I enjoyed the

                            pairing
                            type with each concept in order to bring the combination mark together.

                        <p>Among the warm water and picturesque beaches, there is an infamouse surf break that
                            gathers
                            surfers from around the world. The iconic wave has transformed this quiet fishing
                            village
                            into a thriving beach town, hosting millions of visitors annually. Drawing
                            inspiration from
                            traditional Oaxacan patterns, the wave signifies the city's connection to the ocean.

                        <p>This concept was inspired by traditional Oaxacan ceramics. The use of red clay spans
                            centuries and is a beautiful aspect of Mexican culture. The pot is seen as a gift,
                            welcoming
                            visitors to a culturally rich land. The face on the pot is kind and warm but should
                            be
                            received with respect. There is a coffee plant extending from the top of the pot,
                            honoring
                            the port's history, when coffee was shipped from the harbor.</p>

                        <p>This concept was inspired by the tale of a young indigenious woman who was kidnapped
                            by
                            spanish pirates. While anchored in the bay, she managed to escape one night and swim
                            ashore,
                            hiding in the jungle as they searched for her. She was never found and they gave her
                            the
                            name <em>la escondida</em>, the hidden one, which soon evolved into the name of the
                            town. I
                            wanted
                            to show an abstract view of swell filling into the bay that slowly transitions to a
                            woman's
                            face, implying a hidden woman.</p>

                        <p class="observe-me animate-from-right">For the final design, I chose to go with the
                            traditional
                            red clay pottery. It resonated
                            effectively with the target audience, while beautifully capturing the town's rich
                            heritage and
                            culture. I paired the welcoming mark with a slab serif to convey strength and
                            confidence, reflecting
                            the character of Puerto Escondido's people—a delicate blend of pride and hospitality.
